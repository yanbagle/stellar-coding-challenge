# StellarCodingChallenge

Hi! 

To run this locally:
1) clone project
2) npm install
3) npm start

In browser go to http://localhost:4200/

I implemented the smart/dumb component design pattern in this challenge. For the drop down component, I placed it 
under the common-components folder and made it as generic as possible as I feel this would be used in many places 
in the application. The example-container component is the smart component that houses the dropdown component. 
It is responsible for making service calls to retrieve the list of movies and for passing down that data. I also wrote 
a couple of unit tests for both components. Thanks a lot for your time!
